description,NA,description,"While counting numbers is quite common, little is known about the true meaning of numbers. In this study, a series of random numbers was generated. Surprisingly, we found no evidence that numbers alone are inherently meaningful. This study suggests that numbers are not sufficient to explain their own meaning."
